## Getting Started with Spring Boot - Goals

**Description:**
Spring Boot is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Spring-based applications. It provides a quick and easy way to create standalone, production-grade applications. The primary goals of Spring Boot are to:

* **Speed up development:** By providing out-of-the-box configurations and dependencies, Spring Boot reduces the amount of boilerplate code that developers need to write.
* **Simplify configuration:** Spring Boot automatically configures common settings, such as database connections and web servers, making it easier to get started.
* **Create standalone applications:** Spring Boot applications can be packaged as executable JAR or WAR files, making them easy to deploy and run.

## Understanding the World Before Spring Boot - 10000 Feet Overview

**Description:**
Before Spring Boot came along, developing Spring-based applications involved a lot of manual configuration. Developers had to manually configure dependencies, create XML configuration files, and set up web servers. This process was time-consuming and error-prone. Spring Boot simplified this process by providing a convention over configuration approach.

## Understanding the Goal of Spring Boot

**Description:**
The goal of Spring Boot is to simplify the development of Spring-based applications. It does this by providing a convention over configuration approach, which means that it automatically configures common settings. This allows developers to focus on writing business logic instead of worrying about configuration details.

## Understanding Spring Boot Magic - Spring Boot Starter Projects

**Description:**
Spring Boot starter projects are pre-packaged dependencies that contain everything you need to get started with a specific technology. For example, the Spring Boot Web starter contains everything you need to build web applications. This makes it easy to add new features to your Spring Boot application.

## Understanding Spring Boot Magic - Auto Configuration

**Description:**
Spring Boot auto configuration automatically configures common settings based on the dependencies you have added to your project. For example, if you add the Spring Boot Web starter, Spring Boot will automatically configure a Tomcat web server. This simplifies the configuration process and reduces the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
